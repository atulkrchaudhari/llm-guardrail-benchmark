# LLM Guardrail Benchmark (guardbench)

A regression benchmark for LLM guardrails, with every attack mapped to MITRE ATLAS.

Put any guardrail behind one interface, run it against a labelled suite of attacks and benign traffic, and get a block rate per attack category, a false positive rate, and a pass or fail for CI. Every attack is tagged with its MITRE ATLAS technique.

It answers the question a security review will ask: when the policy changed last week, what did it stop catching?

## Install

```
pip install -e .                 # core, no dependencies
pip install -e ".[presidio]"     # add Microsoft Presidio
pip install -e ".[llm-guard]"    # add Protect AI LLM Guard
pip install -e ".[bedrock]"      # add Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
pip install -e ".[http]"         # test a guardrail behind an HTTP endpoint
```

Python 3.10 or later.

## Use

```
guardbench list                                   # which adapters can run here
guardbench run                                    # run everything available
guardbench run --adapters layered-guard --format json --out report.json
guardbench run --adapters http-guardrail --fail-under 0.85 --max-fpr 0.25
```

`--fail-under` and `--max-fpr` turn the benchmark into a gate. The command exits 1 when a guardrail drops below the block rate or goes above the false positive rate you set. This repository runs that gate on every push (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## What it measures

Each case names the field it arrives in, because the right policy differs.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `input` | What the user typed |
| `context` | Retrieved documents, tool output, memory. Untrusted data |
| `output` | What the model wants to send back or pass to a tool |

The built-in suite has 47 cases: 35 attacks and 12 benign.

| Category | Cases | MITRE ATLAS |
|---|---|---|
| Direct prompt injection, including one non-English case | 6 | AML.T0051.000 |
| System prompt extraction | 3 | AML.T0056 |
| Jailbreak | 3 | AML.T0054 |
| Obfuscation (base64, leetspeak, zero-width, full-width, letter spacing) | 5 | AML.T0068 |
| Indirect injection through documents, agent instruction files, tool descriptions and memory | 8 | AML.T0051.001, AML.T0070, AML.T0110, AML.T0080.000 |
| Exfiltration through tools and links | 5 | AML.T0086, AML.T0053 |
| Data leakage in output | 5 | AML.T0057, AML.T0055 |
| Benign, including look-alikes | 12 | |

Technique IDs follow ATLAS v5.6.0.

## Results

Run on the built-in suite.

| Category | pattern-baseline | layered-guard | presidio-pii |
|---|---|---|---|
| direct_injection | 4/6 | 4/6 | 0/6 |
| system_prompt_extraction | 1/3 | 1/3 | 0/3 |
| jailbreak | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0/3 |
| obfuscation | 3/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 |
| indirect_injection | 2/8 | 7/8 | 0/8 |
| tool_exfiltration | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 |
| data_leakage | 5/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 |
| **block rate** | **51%** | **86%** | **6%** |
| false positive rate | 8% | 25% | 0% |
| precision | 95% | 91% | 100% |

Findings

1. **Keyword matching fails where agents are most exposed.** The baseline blocks none of the five exfiltration attempts and two of eight indirect injections.
2. **Three model-free layers lift the block rate from 51% to 86%.** Restore obfuscated input before scanning, treat instructions inside retrieved data as a finding in themselves, and check outbound destinations against an allowlist.
3. **That gain costs false positives.** The context rule also blocks an onboarding guide (B8) and a harmless `AGENTS.md` that says what "agents and humans should" do (B11). The false positive rate rises from 8% to 25%.
4. **Paraphrase defeats every pattern.** Cases D3, S2 and S3 contain no trigger words and pass both pattern-based guards. This is the argument for a trained classifier as a further layer.
5. **So does another language.** The same direct injection written in Hindi (D6) passes both pattern-based guards untouched.
6. **Tool descriptions are an injection surface.** A poisoned tool description (I7) that asks for a credentials file passes the reference guard, because nothing in it names the assistant or an outside destination.
7. **A PII detector is not an injection detector.** Presidio is the right tool for redaction. It catches card numbers, emails and IBANs, and misses API keys and connection strings, which are secrets, not personal data.

LLM Guard and Bedrock Guardrails have adapters. Their results are not published here yet.

## Adapters

| Name | What it is | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern-baseline` | Regex on raw text. The floor to measure against | Nothing |
| `layered-guard` | Reference implementation: input restoration, untrusted-context rule, destination allowlist | Nothing |
| `presidio-pii` | Microsoft Presidio on output | `.[presidio]` and a spaCy model |
| `llm-guard` | Protect AI LLM Guard prompt-injection classifier | `.[llm-guard]` |
| `bedrock-guardrail` | Amazon Bedrock Guardrails through `ApplyGuardrail` | `BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_ID`, AWS credentials |
| `http-guardrail` | Any guardrail service | `GUARDRAIL_URL` |

### Test your own guardrail service

```
export GUARDRAIL_URL=https://guardrail.internal.example/v1/check
export GUARDRAIL_KEY=...
export GUARDRAIL_TEXT_FIELD=prompt      # request field that carries the text, default "text"
export GUARDRAIL_BLOCK_FIELD=flagged    # response field that is true on block, default "blocked"
guardbench run --adapters http-guardrail
```

The adapter posts `{"<text field>": "...", "field": "input" | "context" | "output"}` and reads one boolean from the response. A timeout or an error is scored as a block. A guardrail that cannot be reached has to fail closed, so the benchmark holds it to that.

### Add an adapter

```python
from guardbench import Adapter, Verdict, load_suite, run_benchmark

class MyGuard(Adapter):
    name = "my-guard"

    def check(self, text, field):
        return Verdict(blocked="secret" in text, reason="keyword")

report = run_benchmark([MyGuard()], load_suite())[0]
print(report.block_rate, report.false_positive_rate, report.missed)
```

### Bring your own cases

One JSON object per line. Pass the file with `--suite`.

```json
{"id": "X1", "category": "indirect_injection", "atlas": "AML.T0051.001", "field": "context", "block": true, "text": "..."}
```

## Evidence log

`guardbench.EvidenceLog` is an append-only decision log in which each record stores the SHA-256 hash of the record before it. Records carry the principal, the agent, the parent agent, the requested and granted scope, and the policy version.

```
guardbench verify-log evidence.jsonl --head <hash of the last record>
```

Editing or deleting a record breaks the chain. Truncating the end of the log does not, which is why the head hash must be anchored somewhere the log's owner cannot edit. The tests cover all three cases.

## Example: indirect injection against a RAG agent

```
pip install -e ".[examples]"
python examples/rag_agent.py
```

A support agent retrieves a ticket that tells it to call `http_get` on an attacker URL with the customer's email and order history.

| Setup | Outcome |
|---|---|
| No guardrail | The agent calls the attacker URL with the customer's data |
| Guardrail on context and tool calls | The ticket is dropped before the model reads it. The agent answers the question |
| Guardrail on tool calls only | The model is hijacked, and the call is blocked at the destination allowlist |

Tool calls are recorded, never executed. The default model is a stand-in that obeys every instruction in its context, which is the worst case and keeps the run repeatable. Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL` to run it against a real model.

## Threat model

[docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) models a runtime guardrail API: assets, trust boundaries, 15 threats with their ATLAS techniques and mitigations, and a mapping to the NIST AI RMF and to Articles 12 and 50 of the EU AI Act.

## Limits

- 47 cases is a regression set, not a leaderboard. Use it to catch a policy change that makes things worse, and add cases from your own incidents.
- Single-turn only. Multi-turn attacks that look benign at every step are out of scope for now.
- English, with one Hindi case. Multilingual coverage is planned.
- All attack strings are standard test phrases. Domains are reserved `example` domains and every key is fake.

## Development
